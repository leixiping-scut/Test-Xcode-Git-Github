# Test-Xcode-Git-Github
### First try of using Xcode with Git and Github<br>

First choosing Github as the repository, I cannot create a local Git at the same time.

First choosing local Git as the repository, I cannot push the project to Github.

So for one project, I can only choose it to exist on a local Git or online Github.
